# Do your Forensic ANALyst job

# WRITE-UP FIC20 // CH03

### SUBJECT
We found this USB key in the pocket of a criminal, are you able to analyze it and find his secret.

### ANALYSING .RAW FILE
When this challenge starts, we have at our disposal a `.raw` file.  
We quickly deduce that this file was extracted from a usb key, in this case that of the hacker in question.  

At first, we try to flash it on a usb key with the `dd` utility.  

When the operation is finished, a partition has been created, there is a fairly large unallocated block and it is impossible for us to mount the key.  

We can see using a tool like `gparted` that the existing partition has a `bitlocker` file system.

Bitlocker is the encrypted partition format proprietary to Windows: we therefore have before us a partition encrypted in __AES__, readable via Windows and the __Bitlocker-On-Go__ system (suitable for usb devices).  
By learning a little about this file system, we learn that the partition is unlockable thanks to two passwords, via the `user authentication` and `recovery` methods.  
User authentication is a key created by the user of the key.  
The recovery key is a __48 character key__ generated when the device is used for the first time.
The unlocking keys being themselves encrypted within the partition, it is impossible for us to find them.

Our only means of access will therefore be to find a password, recovery is much too long (even if a good algorithm could allow it to be found, its generation based on precise calculations and multiples). And when you have nothing at hand, you have to go through the bruteforce.  

### CRACKING BITLOCKER PASSWORD
For this, two methods:

The __first__ is from bruteforce by creating a script integrating the `dislocker` utility, being the linux tool allowing to unlock bitlocker partitions with a password.  
The password being in the arguments, we can inject a dictionary there which will launch the command with each password as long as this one does not return 0.  

```
sudo dislocker -r -V /dev/sdb1 -u{user_password} -- /media/bitlocker
```

The __method__, the one we used, is to extract hashes from the .raw file, and bruteforce them with a dictionary.  
This is in a more optimized sense, because we only need .raw and not interaction with a device like in the first method.  

To extract hashes, we use the `bitlocker2john` utility, available by default on `Kali Linux`.  
During its execution, it will output 4 hashes to us:  
- User Password
- User Password with MAC verification
- Recovery Password fast attack
- Recovery Password with MAC verification

We store them in a text file, and now we need to bruteforce them, compare each password in the wordlist to each hash until we find the right one.  
For this part, we are staying on a tool of the same suite, John.  
We simply pass it as an argument the file containing our hashes and a list of words.

Quickly, John will give us a result:  
The password is .. `password`.  
(Astonishing? Not really, password being on the podium of the most used passwords.)  

So we can move on, and mount our encrypted partition to access it!  
Once inside, we find several files including a flag.txt which contains this message:
```
Every Forensic investigation starts with a good bitlocker inspection.

Try Harder !
```

### LET'S FIND THE FILES

By analyzing the NTFS, we manage to extract several zip files, containing a fic.txt with this url:

```

By going to this link, we find a string encoded in base64, which we quickly decode to have the flag, `https://ctf.hexpresso.fr/1ea967f52d1aab327d084efd24d04957`.
