# FIC2020-CTF

The __FIC 2020 prequalification challenge__, organized by the __Hexpresso__ team, took place from December 12 to 19, 2019.  
Through __6__ challenges and a final selection test, it allowed 14 teams to select themselves for the final which will take place at the "Forum International de la Cybersécurité" (FIC).  

The format of this CTF was a __"Follow The Rabbit"__: the goal was therefore to advance from step to step, while having to solve each challenge to move to the next. It changes from _Jeopardy_ and brings a certain conductive line. 

Here are the different challenges that included the pre-qualifications and the write-ups of those that my team and I passed.  

1. [__First Step for First Flag__ (OSINT/JS)](https://github.com/atz-dev/FIC2020-CTF/blob/master/01-flag.md)
2. [__Old EXFIL but Gold__ (PCAP/DNS)](https://github.com/atz-dev/FIC2020-CTF/blob/master/02-exfil.md)
3. [__Do your forensic ANALyst job__ (Forensic)](https://github.com/atz-dev/FIC2020-CTF/blob/master/03-bitlocker.md)
4. [__Wannacry is f*cking back__ (Reverse Engineering/Crypto)](https://github.com/atz-dev/FIC2020-CTF/blob/master/04-wannacry.md)
5. __Pyjail 4 Fun__ (Python) (Not solved)
6. __Host Fetcher__ (Pwn) (Not solved)
7. __Heap Overflow__ (C/Mem) (Not solved)

This challenge was realistic and very enriching by the diversity and the complexity of the different challenges, making it very pleasant to make sometimes despite long hours of head taking (but it would not be a CTF otherwise :wink:)
